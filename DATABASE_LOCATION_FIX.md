# Database Location Fix - Summary

## ❌ Problem Identified

The database file `EmployAI.db` was being created/accessed in the wrong location (`backend/EmployAI.db`) instead of the correct location (`backend/api/EmployAI.db`).

## ✅ Correct Database Location

The database should **always** be located at:

```
D:\Work\Cloud-rep\backend\api\EmployAI.db
```

## 🔧 Why This Location?

1. The FastAPI application runs from the `backend/api/` directory
2. The `database.py` file uses `sqlite:///./EmployAI.db` which creates the file in the current working directory
3. When the app runs with `cd backend/api && python -m uvicorn main:app`, the database is correctly created in the `api` folder

## 📝 Files Fixed

The following scripts were pointing to the wrong database location and have been corrected:

### 1. ✅ `backend/setup_database.py`

**Before:** `backend_dir / "EmployAI.db"`
**After:** `backend_dir / "api" / "EmployAI.db"`

### 2. ✅ `backend/manual_migration.py`

**Before:** `r"D:\Work\Cloud-rep\backend\EmployAI.db"`
**After:** `r"D:\Work\Cloud-rep\backend\api\EmployAI.db"`

### 3. ✅ `backend/api/test_db_direct.py`

**Before:** `os.path.join(..., "..", "EmployAI.db")`
**After:** `os.path.join(..., "EmployAI.db")`

## 🎯 Correct Application Structure

```
backend/
├── api/
│   ├── main.py              # FastAPI application
│   ├── database.py          # Database models and config
│   ├── EmployAI.db          # ✅ DATABASE GOES HERE
│   └── ...
├── setup_database.py       # Now points to api/EmployAI.db
└── ...
```

## 🚀 How to Start the Application Correctly

### 1. Navigate to the API directory:

```bash
cd D:\Work\Cloud-rep\backend\api
```

### 2. Start the server:

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. The database will automatically be created/used in the correct location

## 🔍 Test Call Fix Applied

The phone number validation fix for E.164 format has been applied to the test call endpoint:

- ✅ Validates phone number is provided
- ✅ Converts 10-digit US numbers to E.164 format (adds +1)
- ✅ Ensures proper format for VAPI API calls
- ✅ Updated frontend dialog for user phone input

## 📞 Test Call Usage

1. Click "Test" on any agent
2. Enter your real phone number in the dialog
3. The system will:
   - Validate the format
   - Convert to E.164 if needed (+1 prefix for US)
   - Make the VAPI call
   - You should receive a call from the agent

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Always run the application from the `backend/api/` directory
- The database file should only exist in `backend/api/EmployAI.db`
- Any database files in `backend/EmployAI.db` are incorrect and should be removed
- All scripts and tests now point to the correct location
